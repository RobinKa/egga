# E-Graph Geometric Algebra (EGGA)

Symbolic [Geometric Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra) with [E-Graphs](https://egraphs-good.github.io/)

Things you can do with this library

- Simplify expressions
- Prove equalities
- Solve for variables

Things that are supported

- Any signature
- Arbitrary number of basis vectors
- Symplectic Geometric Algebra (aka Weyl Algebras)
- Derivatives
- Add your own expression types and rules (with egglog)

Based on the [Python bindings](https://github.com/metadsl/egglog-python) for [egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog)

## Setup

Supports Python 3.8 and higher.

`pip install egga`

## Usage

The first step is to create a `GeometricAlgebra` object with a given signature.
You can then use its basis vectors as well as functions exposed by it. Use the utility methods provided to do things like simplification and
equation solving. In some cases you might need to interface with egglog directly. Below are
some examples for common use-cases.

Simplification

```python
from egga.geometric_algebra import GeometricAlgebra
from egga.utils import simplify

ga = GeometricAlgebra(signature=[1.0, 1.0])
e_0, e_1 = ga.basis_vectors
e_01 = e_0 * e_1

# Build an expression to simplify
expr = e_01 * e_0 * ~e_01

# Prints Simplified: -e("0")
print("Simplified:", simplify(ga, expr))
```

Equation solving

```python
from egglog import union

from egga.geometric_algebra import GeometricAlgebra
from egga.utils import simplify

# Pass eq_solve=True to enable the equation solving rules
ga = GeometricAlgebra(
    signature=[1.0, 1.0],
    eq_solve=True,
)

e_0, e_1 = ga.basis_vectors
e_01 = e_0 * e_1

# Solve e_01 * x * ~e_01 = e_0 for x
x = ga.expr_cls.variable("x")
lhs = e_01 * x * ~e_01
rhs = -e_0

# Make LHS equal to RHS
ga.egraph.register(union(lhs).with_(rhs))

assert str(simplify(ga, x)) == str(ga.expr_cls.e("0"))
```

Equality check

```python
from egga.geometric_algebra import GeometricAlgebra
from egga.utils import check_equality

ga = GeometricAlgebra(signature=[1.0, 1.0])
e_0, e_1 = ga.basis_vectors
e_01 = e_0 * e_1

# Build an lhs to check for equality to an rhs
lhs = e_01 * e_01
rhs = ga.expr_cls.scalar_literal(-1.0)

assert check_equality(ga, lhs, rhs)
```

| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `boolean(x)`         | Mark x as a boolean            |

## Caveats

- Egraphs are bad with associativity (combined with commutativity?) so things can blow up
- Most operations aren't "fully" implemented (eg. `pow` only supports powers of two right now)
